5-methylcytosine (`5mC`)
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (`5hmC`)
N6-methyladenine (`6mA`)

alignment - checking where reads (fastq) best match on reference
bam - store info about how well reads match reference
pod5 - store signal data (good for methylation basecalling)
index file - links read IDs with their signal-level data


SNV (single nucleotide variation) - (< 1% of population)
SNP (single nucleotide polimorphism) - (> 1% of population, germline (cells that pass on their genetic material to the offspring e.g. sperm, egg, fertilised egg))
SV (structural variation) - region of DNA approximately >=1 kb containing CNVs (copy number variants)
CNV - inversions/balanced translocations/genomic imbalances (insertions/deletions)
CNP - CNV in >1% of population

CpG site - 5'—C—phosphate—G—3'
	- frequently cytosine -methylation-> `5mC`      -deamination-> thymine
