Features of reads used to predict whether the 'error' was caused by mod or not:
	-   current intensity and duration
	-   read quality
	-   base quality scores
	-   mismatch frequency
	-   deletion frequency
	-   insertion frequency
	-   sumErr
these features can be organized in per-base and per-kmer formats
