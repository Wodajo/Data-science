basecalling - aka sequencing
quality control - quality of sequenced data (how does it work?)
variants calling - compare reads with reference to look out for variants
genome assembly - if we don't have reference we use maaany reads to assemble most probable sequence, right?
epigenetics - how?



## STEP BY STEP PROCESSES:

### illumina
DNA -> fragments -> assembly due to reference
flow cell

explain step-by-step how illumina and nanopore works
