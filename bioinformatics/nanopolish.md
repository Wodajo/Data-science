there are newer programs - abandon that

`nanopolish index -d fast5_files/ output.fastq`
	create an index file that links read IDs with their signal-level data in the FAST5 files



hidden Markov models (HMMs) can be used to analyze nanopore sequencing data
HMM computes the probability of observing a sequence of signal-level events, given a specific nucleotide sequence (e.g. for methylation discovery sake)
