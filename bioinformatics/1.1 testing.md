	- do I have/should I remove *reverse strand* flag? (`-F 2324`)
	- is deleting low alignment score (`-q 10`) at this moment a good idea?




Annoying:
```
UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found
to be incompatible with the existing python installation in your environment:

Specifications:

  - pysam -> python[version='>=3.7,<3.8.0a0']

Your python: python=3.10

If python is on the left-most side of the chain, that's the version you've asked for.
When python appears to the right, that indicates that the thing on the left is somehow
not available for the python version you are constrained to. Note that conda will not
change your python version to a different minor version unless you explicitly specify
that.

The following specifications were found to be incompatible with your system:

  - feature:/linux-64::__glibc==2.37=0
  - feature:|@/linux-64::__glibc==2.37=0

Your installed version is: 2.37
```
I can't install `pysam` due to this (and I should have `python 3.6.7`)

while trying to pip install - legacy-install-failure of `h5py` and metadana-generation-failed of `pandas` (installable with `conda`)



You should learn how to use docker -.-
OR - make my own install script in zsh.
